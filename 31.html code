                <p>Iâ€™m a third-year B.Tech student majoring in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science. I have a strong interest in Machine Learning and have worked on several projects using algorithms like Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, and K-Nearest Neighbors. Iâ€™ve applied these to solve real-world problems such as fraud detection and medical prediction. I enjoy exploring data, building models, and improving their performance through evaluation metrics like accuracy, precision, and recall. I'm now looking to gain hands-on experience through an internship where I can learn and contribute to real ML projects.</p>
